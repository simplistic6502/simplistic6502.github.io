        This page documents regular movement in NTSC SMB1 or SMB2J. Collision is not covered in detail. For that, consult
        Dan Salvato's SMB1 Tile Collision Flowchart. In this article, the player will always be referred to as Mario. Unless
        otherwise stated, all points also apply to Luigi. All variable names are from doppelganger's SMB1 Disassembly.

    <h2 id="Horizontal_Movement">Horizontal Movement</h2>
    <p>
        At any point, Mario may be moving left or right, determined by the sign of his speed
        (<code>Player_X_Speed</code>). His speed is measured in subpixels/frame. In non-water areas, his speed is hard
        capped at ±40 when <code>RunningTimer</code> is set, or soft capped at ±24 otherwise. In water areas, his speed
        is always hard capped at ±24, and soft capped at ±16 on the ground. Note that a "soft cap" refers to the fact
        that in practice it is possible to exceed this cap by holding either no directional inputs or the opposite of
        the directional input corresponding to the direction Mario is traveling. An exception exists during the pipe
        entrance cutscenes (where <code>GameEngineSubroutine == 7</code>) where Mario's speed is hard capped to 12.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mario's subspeed (<code>Player_X_MoveForce</code>) is only used in calculating acceleration, and does not
        contribute to updating his position.
    </p>
    <p>
        <code>RunningTimer</code> is always set to 10 when B is held, Mario is on the ground and the directional inputs
        held correspond to the direction Mario is moving (<code>Left_Right_Buttons == Player_MovingDir</code>, where
        <code>Left_Right_Buttons</code> is set to <code>SavedJoypadBits &amp; 0x03</code>). It decrements by 1 every
        frame these conditions aren't met.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Acceleration">Acceleration</h3>
    <h4 id="Explanation">Explanation</h4>
    <p>
        Mario's horizontal acceleration is stored in <code>FrictionAdderHigh</code> and <code>FrictionAdderLow</code>,
        following this algorithm:
    </p>
    <pre>$00 := 0

<b>if</b> Player_State != 0 <b>then</b> <i>/* if Mario is in the air */</i>
    <b>if</b> Player_XSpeedAbsolute &lt; 25 <b>then</b>
        $00 := $00 + 1
        
        <b>if</b> RunningSpeed <b>then</b> <i>/* RunningSpeed is set if Player_XSpeedAbsolute &gt;= 28 and is only unset if Left_Right_Buttons == Player_MovingDir and Player_XSpeedAbsolute &lt; 28 */</i>
            $00 := $00 + 1
        <b>end</b>
    <b>end</b>
<b>else</b> <i>/* if Mario is on the ground */</i>
    <b>if</b> AreaType == 0 <b>then</b> <i>/* if in water area */</i>
        $00 := $00 + 1
    <b>else</b> <b>if</b> Left_Right_Buttons != Player_MovingDir <b>then</b>
        $00 := $00 + 1
        
        <b>if</b> RunningSpeed <b>then</b>
            $00 := $00 + 1
        <b>end</b>
    <b>else</b> <b>if</b> !(A_B_Buttons &amp; #B_Button) <b>and</b> !RunningTimer <b>then</b> <i>/* If B button is not pressed and RunningTimer is not set */</i>
        $00 := $00 + 1
    <b>end</b>
<b>end</b>

FrictionAdderLow := FrictionData[$00] <i>/* [0xe4, 0x98, 0xd0] for Mario, [0xb4, 0x68, 0xa0] for Luigi */</i>
FrictionAdderHigh := 0

<b>if</b> PlayerFacingDir != Player_MovingDir <b>then</b>
    <i>/* Double Acceleration */</i>
    FrictionAdderLow := FrictionAdderLow &lt;&lt; 1 <i>/* Rolls bit 7 into carry */</i>
    FrictionAdderHigh := FrictionAdderHigh &lt;&lt; 1 <i>/* Rolls carry bit in */</i>
<b>end</b></pre>
    <p>
        Note that pressing L+R sets <code>PlayerFacingDir</code> to 3 (0b00000011), but <code>Player_MovingDir</code> is
        based solely on the sign of Mario's speed. This means that when L+R is pressed, Mario's horizontal acceleration
        will always be double it's original value.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mario's horizontal acceleration is then applied first to subspeed then to his speed depending on the sign of his
        speed and directional inputs (note that if Mario's speed is zero, his subspeed will not be updated if no buttons
        are held; see the last entry of <a href="#Speed_Resets">#Speed Resets</a>). His speed is then capped to his
        maximum speed which depends on if <code>RunningTimer</code> is set.
    </p>
    <h4 id="Fast_Acceleration">Fast Acceleration</h4>
    <p>
        As Mario accelerates faster when he is facing the opposite direction he is going, one can deliberately take
        advantage of this, performing a trick called a fast acceleration. TASes usually perform what's called a L+R fast
        acceleration, where the inputs <code>L+R, R+A</code> are performed at the beginning of a section. RTA runners,
        who are either console runners physically unable to press the Left and Right D-pad buttons together, or emulator
        players who follow a no L+R rule present on most speedrun leaderboards can still perform a fast acceleration, by
        performing the inputs <code>L, [nothing], R+A</code>. Note that [nothing] means no Left, Right, or A inputs, as
        at least one other button has to be held (see the last entry of <a href="#Speed_Resets">#Speed Resets</a>). The
        same idea is then applied by both RTA runners and TASers to gain maximum running speed quicker.
    </p>
    <h4 id="Subspeed_Manipulation">Subspeed Manipulation</h4>
    <p>
        As there exists no possible acceleration value that sets <code>FrictionAdderLow</code> to 0 (on NTSC), Mario's
        subspeed will fluctuate even when his speed is capped. His subspeed can be frozen by releasing all directional
        inputs while in the air, useful for manipulating the speed at which Mario will accelerate. A common example is
        releasing right for one frame in order to maintain a subspeed of 0xF0 following a L+R fast acceleration,
        allowing Mario to reach the maximum running speed slightly faster.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Speed_Resets">Speed Resets</h3>
    <p>
        Mario's speed is reset to zero when:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mario collides with a wall</li>
        <li>Mario collides with the left side of the screen while holding either Left (0x02), L+R (0x03) or nothing
            (0x00)</li>
        <li>Mario dies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Mario's speed and subspeed are reset to zero when:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mario enters a screen transition</li>
        <li>Mario's absolute speed is less than 11, and any button (other than A and the direction Mario is
            traveling) is pressed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When Mario collects a powerup, the game will consider Mario to be on the ground for exactly one frame,
            allowing <code>RunningTimer</code> to be set. This can be exploited as you can obtain running speed in the
            air after grabbing a powerup. This is used in the category "1-1 as Fire Mario" where the fire flower grab is
            called a darG grab.
       </li>
        <li>
            Leftward movement is fundamentally different than rightward movement, as e.g. +0xD0 speed is stored as 00
            D0, however -0xD0 speed is stored as FF 30 (upper byte signed two's complement), allowing Mario to move one
            subpixel left after only one frame of input from standby (00 00). This allows for fast y-subpixel
            manipulation off the left edge of a platform, as Mario can oscillate between -1 and 1 speed very quickly.
       </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="Wind_(SMB2J)">Wind (SMB2J)</h3>
    <p>
        In SMB2J, depending on whether the most significant bit of the frame counter is set, wind pushes Mario by one
        pixel every two or four frames (<code>FrameCounter &amp; 0b10000000 ? 2 : 4</code>). This can be exploited as a
        method to clip into walls with much more leniency than normal, or even to fully clip while Mario is traveling
        downwards, which is otherwise impossible.
    </p>
    <h2 id="Vertical_Movement">Vertical Movement</h2>
    <p>
        Vertical movement behaves much like horizontal movement, where a positive speed (<code>Player_Y_Speed</code>)
        represents downwards movement and a negative speed represents upwards movement. Unlike with horizontal movement,
        Mario's subspeed (<code>Player_Y_MoveForce</code>) is applied to his subpixel value, as vertical movement would
        be jarring otherwise.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Gravity">Gravity</h3>
    <p>
        Mario's gravity is only set under 4 different conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>When going through a screen transition, Mario's downwards gravity is set to 0x28</li>
        <li>When Mario is above bounds in a water area, Mario's downwards gravity is set to 0x18</li>
        <li>When Mario lands on a spring, his upwards gravity is set to 0x70. In SMB2J, his downwards gravity is also set to
            0x70.</li>
        <li>When Mario jumps or swims (bouncing off a spring does not count, however jumping off a spring does count),
            his upwards and downwards gravity is set following this algorithm:</li>
    </ul>
    <pre><b>if</b> Player_State == 0 <b>or</b> (SwimmingFlag != 0 <b>and</b> (JumpSwimTimer != 0 <b>or</b> Player_Y_Speed &gt;= 0)) <b>then</b> <i>/* If Mario is on the ground, or Mario is swimming and either JumpSwimTimer is set or his speed is nonnegative */</i>
    JumpSwimTimer := 32 <i>/* Reset timer */</i>
    y_register := 0
    Player_YMF_Dummy := 0 <i>/* Reset y subpixel */</i>
    
    JumpOrigin_Y_Position := Player_Y_Position <i>/* Used for an edge case at the very beginning of Mario's jump where Player_Y_Speed &lt; 0 and A_B_Buttons &amp; PreviousA_B_Buttons &amp; 0b10000000 == 0 */</i>
    Player_State := 1
    
    <b>for</b> i := 0; i &lt; 4 <b>do</b>
        <b>if</b> Player_XSpeedAbsolute &lt; [9, 16, 25, 28][i] <b>then</b>
            <b>break</b>
        <b>end</b>
        
        y_register := y_register + 1
    <b>end</b>
    
    <b>if</b> SwimmingFlag != 0 <b>then</b> <i>/* If Mario is swimming */</i>
        y_register := 5
        
        <b>if</b> Whirlpool_Flag != 0 <b>then</b> <i>/* If Mario is in a whirlpool */</i>
            y_register := y_register + 1
        <b>end</b>
    <b>end</b>
    
    VerticalForce := JumpMForceData[y_register] <i>/* [0x20, 0x20, 0x1e, 0x28, 0x28, 0x0d, 0x04] for Mario, [0x18, 0x18, 0x18, 0x22, 0x22, 0x0d, 0x04] for Luigi */</i>
    VerticalForceDown := FallMForceData[y_register] <i>/* [0x70, 0x70, 0x60, 0x90, 0x90, 0x0a, 0x09] for Mario, [0x42, 0x42, 0x3e, 0x5d, 0x5d, 0x0a, 0x09] for Luigi */</i>
    Player_Y_MoveForce := InitMForceData[y_register] <i>/* [0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00] */</i>
    Player_Y_Speed := PlayerYSpdData[y_register] <i>/* [0xfc, 0xfc, 0xfc, 0xfb, 0xfb, 0xfe, 0xff] */</i>
    
    <b>if</b> SwimmingFlag != 0 <b>and</b> Player_Y_Position &lt; 20 <b>then</b> <i>/* Check if above bounds in water areas */</i>
        Player_Y_Speed := 0
    <b>end</b>
<b>end</b></pre>
    <p>
        Note that upwards and downwards gravity are stored in <code>VerticalForce</code> and
        <code>VerticalForceDown</code> respectively. Only <code>VerticalForce</code> is ever applied to Mario's speed
        and subspeed. <code>VerticalForceDown</code> is copied to <code>VerticalForce</code> when Mario is in the air
        and either his speed is greater or equal to zero, or the A button has been released.
    </p>
    <h4 id="Low_Gravity">Low Gravity</h4>
    <p>
        Since Mario's downwards gravity is set to a low value (0x28) through screen transitions, he appears to fall very
        slowly. Since bouncing on enemies does not set his gravity, this is used in the SMB1 A Button Challenge TAS to cross
        large gaps in 1-1 and 8-2 without jumping.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Speed">Speed</h3>
    <p>
        Mario's speed is set in the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>When Mario jumps, his speed is set to <code>PlayerYSpdData[y_register]</code>, and his subspeed is set to
            <code>InitMForceData[y_register]</code> (see pseudocode above for exact values).</li>
        <li>When Mario bumps a soft block, his vertical speed is set to 0 if the block does not break, or -2 if it
            does. His subspeed is not changed.</li>
        <li>When Mario bumps a hard block (including when the bump timer has not reset yet, as all blocks are hard) or
            the bottom of a moving platform, his speed is set to 1. His subspeed is not changed. Note that all blocks in
            water areas are hard.</li>
        <li>When Mario dies onscreen, his speed is set to -4 and his gravity is set and frozen to 0x28. His subspeed is
            not changed.</li>
        <li>In SMB1, if you bounce off a Cheep Cheep, Bullet Bill, Podoboo, Hammer Bro, Lakitu, or a Blooper Mario's
            speed is set to -3. Any other enemy will set his speed to -4. His subspeed is not changed.</li>
        <li>In SMB2J, if you bounce off a Red Parakoopa or a Flying Green Parakoopa (ones that fly in a fixed path rather than
            bounce on the ground), Mario's speed is set to -8. Any other enemy will set
            his speed to -6. His subspeed is not changed.</li>
        <li>When Mario lands on anything, his speed and subspeed is reset to 0.</li>
        <li>When Mario is climbing, his speed is set to -1 and his subspeed is set to 0x20 when climbing up, or 1 and
            0xff when climbing down.</li>
        <li>When Mario bounces on a red spring, his speed is set to -12 if A is held, and -7 otherwise. His subspeed is
            not explicitly reset however it is always reset beforehand when he lands on the spring. In SMB2J, when Mario bounces
            on a green spring, his speed is set to -32 if A is held, and -7 otherwise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="Speed_Cap">Speed Cap</h4>
    <p>
        The vertical speed cap for all sprite objects (including Mario) is implemented poorly. It checks for whether the
        object's speed and subspeed both exceed their respective intended caps (<code>SprObject_Y_Speed[x_register] &gt;= $02
        <b>and</b> SprObject_Y_MoveForce[x_register] &gt;= 0x80</code>), forgetting to account for when it's speed is above
        the cap, but it's subspeed is below the cap (<code>SprObject_Y_Speed[x_register] &gt; $02</code> <b>and</b>
        <code>SprObject_Y_MoveForce[x_register] &lt; 0x80</code>). This allows Mario (and all other sprite objects) to exceed
        the intended speed cap, with precise subspeed manipulation (e.g. differing jump heights, ceiling bonks, enemy bounces).
        This is generally useless on NTSC, however it can be used in the PAL version to clip into the floor.
